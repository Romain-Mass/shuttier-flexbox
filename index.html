						Sh*ttier is a code formatting tool designed to make your code look
					<p>as terrible as possible, embracing chaos and messiness. It produces</p>

					<p>random indentations, mixed-case inconsistencies, and unpredictable</p>

					<p>spacing, making it the antithesis of tools like Prettier. While it</p>

					<p></p>functions deterministically, it is ultimately a humorous project

					<p></p>more suitable for pranks rather than serious use. The post also

					<p></p>advises against filing joke pull requests on serious repositories

					<p></p>unless you know the maintainers personally.
